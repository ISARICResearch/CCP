        <p>The Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) is designed for any severe or potentially severe acute infection of public health interest. It is a standardised protocol 
            that enables data and biological samples to be collected rapidly in a globally-harmonised manner.</p>
        ISARIC has partnered with global experts to adapt its Clinical Epidemiology Platform, enabling research on the clinical characteristics of emerging infectious disease outbreaks 
        to guide patient care and inform health policy. Dedicated to enhancing evidence generation, ISARIC provides tools and support for research teams to quickly set up studies address 
        the research questions in their context and inform clinical trial design. The platform is also available for collaborative analyses that can characterise disease outbreaks across 
        different variants, countries, and over time.</p>
    <p>The ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol and the ISARIC Clinical Epidemiology Platform is a suite of openly-available, standardised tools to support your research and facilitate global
    collaboration.  Tools within this platform will help you to create a Case Report Form (CRF), launch a database, and perform statistical analysis on the data you collect.The resources are free to use. ISARIC provides support
    to implement them and supports researchers to retain control of the data and samples they collect.</p>

    <!-- Steps for operationalisation  -->
        
             <h3>Steps for operationalisation of CCP </h3>
                 <p>The ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) provides a standardised method for the rapid, coordinated clinical investigation of emerging health threats to inform clinical care, public health response, and clinical trial design. 
                 This protocol can be tailored to fit any context. Researchers may add additional research questions, customise the procedures to their sites, and alter the investigations according to their priorities and available resources.</p>
            <p>This page provides an overview of the main steps for implementation the CCP and operationalise our tools.It is important that the study is not seen as a separate activity 
                in the facility’s response strategy to the infection of interest. 
            <p>A Principal Investigator must be appointed. They will be responsible for all aspects of the study, following the main steps outlined below.</p>
      
           <p>We ask that ISARIC is acknowledged and informed if you implement the protocol. Ethical approval of the protocol and all necessary operational and financial arrangements are the responsibility of the investigators.</p>

             <h3>Sampling </h3>
                      <p>  In some circumstances, robust analysis requires methodical selection of patients for data collection. This is usually the case where the primary aim is large-scale
                        data collection to explore the features of, and risk factors for, illness. Each site has its own requirements, abilities, and limitations to participant recruitment 
                        and should select the sampling approach that fits best.

       <ul>
         <li>  Ad hoc - Screen all patient as you are able without systematic selection</li>
 <li>  <b>Census </b> - Screen all potential participants who present to your setting.</li>
  <li> <b>Census for a defined population </b> - Screen all patients admitted to ICU.</li>
  <li> <b>Sequential/systematic sampling</b> - Screen patients based on their time of presentation. E.g., every 3rd patient who presents to the hospital, or all patients who present on even calendar days (2nd, 4th, 6th)</li>
  <li> <b>Simple random sampling</b> - Use a tool to randomly determine if each patient is screened. E.g., use an online tool to generate a random list of Yes/No variables in the desired proportion and apply them sequentially as patients present (note: this should be done so that no one knows the next variable)</li>
  <li> <b>Opportunistic</b> - No defined or consistent criteria. Patients are screened as and when staff have time available (note: this is not ideal, but sometimes necessary).</li>

              <h3>Statistical Analysis Plan </h3>
   <p>An ISARIC Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) has been developed to align with the CCP and ISARIC ARchetype CRFs. This can be tailored to your needs and used for data analysis.
        <h3>Visualisation and analysis tools </h3>
       ISARIC also provides a set of analytic tools called VERTEX, designed to perform the analyses outlined in the SAP using ISARIC's data structures. 
       VERTEX generates tables and visualisations using Python code, and displays this information for each relevant research question or study endpoint,
       in a web application dashboard.
        VERTEX is built using reproducible analytical pipelines. It is designed to allow ISARIC partners and the broader scientific community to develop, contribute to, and share their own analytic 
       codes so that other researchers can use and reproduce them. </p>
