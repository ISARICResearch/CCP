        <p>The Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) is designed for any severe or potentially severe acute infection of public health interest. It is a standardised protocol 
            that enables data and biological samples to be collected rapidly in a globally-harmonised manner.</p>
        ISARIC has partnered with global experts to adapt its Clinical Epidemiology Platform, enabling research on the clinical characteristics of emerging infectious disease outbreaks 
        to guide patient care and inform health policy. Dedicated to enhancing evidence generation, ISARIC provides tools and support for research teams to quickly set up studies address 
        the research questions in their context and inform clinical trial design. The platform is also available for collaborative analyses that can characterise disease outbreaks across 
        different variants, countries, and over time.</p>
    <p>The ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol and the ISARIC Clinical Epidemiology Platform is a suite of openly-available, standardised tools to support your research and facilitate global
    collaboration.  Tools within this platform will help you to create a Case Report Form (CRF), launch a database, and perform statistical analysis on the data you collect.The resources are free to use. ISARIC provides support
    to implement them and supports researchers to retain control of the data and samples they collect.</p>


    <!-- Steps for operationalisation  -->
        
             <h3>Steps for operationalisation of CCP </h3>
    
            <p>This page provides an overview of the main steps for implementation the CCP and operationalise our tools.It is important that the study is not seen as a separate activity 
                in the facility’s response strategy to the infection of interest. 
            <p>A Principal Investigator must be appointed. They will be responsible for all aspects of the study, following the main steps outlined below.</p>
      
           <p>We ask that ISARIC is acknowledged and informed if you implement the protocol. Ethical approval of the protocol and all necessary operational and financial arrangements are the responsibility of the investigators.</p>

         <h3>Protocol  </h3>
             <p>The ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) provides a standardised method for the rapid, coordinated clinical investigation of emerging health threats to inform clinical care, public health response, and clinical trial design. 
                 This protocol can be tailored to fit any context. Researchers may add additional research questions, customise the procedures to their sites, and alter the investigations according to their priorities and available resources.

                Several sites have used the CCP to create their own regionally-specific versions for specific response activities. Examples are available at the links below.
                    <h3>Ethics and regulatory approval  </h3>
                       <p>  Be sure to obtain relevant the ethics and regulatory approvals required for your study

         <h3>Case Report Form </h3>
             <p> ISARIC and partners have developed a ARChetype standardised case report form (CRF) for mpox, H5Nx, Covid and Dengue . The form includes the variables needed to 
            efficiently characterise the natural history of mpox across clades, regions, time and populations. It is structured to quickly identify risk factors for severe outcomes, 
            understand the mechanisms of disease, and provide key evidence to inform the design of clinical trials.

           <p> You can use the ISARIC ARChetype  CRF as designed, or tailor it to your context by adding or removing variables using our <a href="path-to-doc7.pdf" target=""_blank">BRIDGE tool. </a></p>

           <h3>Set up a database for data capture </h3>
           <p> After using BRIDGE to select your final CRF, BRIDGE will generate a download of the paper CRF and create a CRF completion guide. It will also generate an XML file and 
            data dictionary to set up a REDCap database that matches your CRF.
           <ul>
            <li> If your institution uses REDCap, upload the XML file and data dictionary to a REDCap project to launch a database for your study.

            The data dictionary can also be used to design a database in any other data management software you prefer.</li> 
            <p> ISARIC has a REDCap database for all the ARChetype CRFs available for use by any sites that decide not to run their own data management software. Support and hosting are
               provided by ISARIC.

              <h3>Statistical Analysis Plan </h3>
   <p>An ISARIC Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) has been developed to align with the CCP and ISARIC ARchetype CRFs. This can be tailored to your needs and used for data analysis.
        <h3>Visualisation and analysis tools </h3>
       ISARIC also provides a set of analytic tools called VERTEX, designed to perform the analyses outlined in the SAP using ISARIC's data structures. 
       VERTEX generates tables and visualisations using Python code, and displays this information for each relevant research question or study endpoint,
       in a web application dashboard.
        VERTEX is built using reproducible analytical pipelines. It is designed to allow ISARIC partners and the broader scientific community to develop, contribute to, and share their own analytic 
       codes so that other researchers can use and reproduce them. </p>
